   <p class="desc">Originating from the Shaanxi province in China, 
    Sage is a Radiant healer whose capacity to turn the tide of battle is immeasurable. 
    She is the seventh Agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL.
    Sage has a kind and compassionate personality, considered by some to be almost 'mother-like'. While still relatively young, 
    Sage exudes an inner wisdom of someone much older and more mature. She genuinely cares about the wellbeing of her allies, 
    and places great emphasis on collaboration and team victories over personal glory.</p>

    </div>
    </div>
    <p class="desc">Omen is the first Radiant to join the VALORANT Protocol, 
    and has a mysterious and dark past that is intertwined with Viper's. 
    The central focus of Omen's character is an unknown event or accident that occurred in his past, 
    resulting in him being 'ripped apart', and transformed from a human into his current state.
    The theme of critical elements of Omen's backstory and lore being 'unknown' is a recurring one, 
    with several key plot points and events simply being missing or unclear, never fully described or explained. 
    This seems to have been the general and intentional theme around Omen, with him being the 'mysterious and edgy' character, 
    who's own amnesia mirrors our lack of knowledge about him.</p>

    <p class="desc">Jett is of South Korean descent. 
        She was the 10th Agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL, 
        and is among the youngest of its members.
        Jett is often regarded as having a 'toxic' attitude towards people. 
        She prefers to do things her own way, without relying on a team, 
        and is greatly confident in her own abilities. 
        Jett's immense self-confidence can come across as arrogance, 
        and feel as if she is disregarding her comrade's safety, 
        however her voice lines indicate that she is opening up to those around her. 
        They suggest that she does care for her friends, 
        but doesn't know how to show it.</p>

    <p class="role">Sentinels</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p class="desc">Killjoy is the 4th Agent to join the PROTOCOL. 
        She is a young tech user and a genius, who uses various gadgets and bots of her own invention in combat. 
        She is of German origin, (however, only one of her parents being of German ancestry).
        The focal point of Killjoy's personality is her incredible mind. 
        She is without doubt the smartest Agent in the PROTOCOL, a fact that she is very well aware of.
        This manifests itself in a strong confidence in herself and her intelligence, not without a fair share of bragging. 
        She is proud and willful, with a high feeling of self-importance.</p>

    <p class="desc">Viper is a brilliant scientist coming from the United States. 
        She is the second member of the VALORANT PROTOCOL, joining along with Brimstone, 
        and is the second-in-command of the PROTOCOL.
        While once a brilliant scientist, she no longer thinks clearly, having become hateful and biased in her tests. 
        Her personality reflects this through the passive-aggressiveness present in all her interactions and the resentment she feels towards others. 
        Almost every Agent, at some point or the other, 
        comments on her hate-driven mind. Despite this she is able to express appreciation, 
        being willing to congratulate those who have impressed her.</p>
